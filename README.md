# ♻️ Scrap Pickup Platform – React Native Apps

This project contains **two mobile apps** built with React Native and Expo:

- 📱 **Customer App** – Used by customers to schedule scrap pickups, track pickup status, and approve item prices.
- 🤝 **Partner App** – Used by pickup partners to manage requests, verify pickup codes, and submit item details.

The backend is simulated using **json-server** to mock APIs locally.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DWARA-KESH/EpiCircleDemo.git
cd EpiCircleDemo
```

### 2. Install JSON Server Globally
```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

### 3. Start the Mock Backend
```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

Make sure `db.json` contains pickup entries with required fields like:

```json
{
  "pickups": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "status": "Pending",
      "date": "2025-07-10",
      "timeSlot": "10:00 AM",
      "address": "123 Example Street",
      "mapLink": "https://maps.google.com",
      "pickupCode": "",
      "items": [],
      "totalAmount": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📲 Running Customer or Partner App

### 1. Go to the desired app folder:
```bash
cd customer-app   # OR cd partner-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Expo Server
```bash
npx expo start --clear --port PORTNUMBER #(8081 - for CustomerAp, 8082 - for PartnerApp)
```

You can now:
- 📷 Scan the QR code using Expo Go  
- 🌐 Press `w` to launch it in a web browser  

> 🔄 Make sure to update the Axios base URL in both apps to match your machine’s IP address:

```js
// Replace this:
http://localhost:3000

// With something like:
http://Your.System.IP.Address:3000
```

## 🧭 Status Flow

### Customer App Flow
```
Login → Schedule Pickup → Status Tracking
→ Shows Pickup Code only during 'In-Process'
→ Final Review & Approval
```

### Partner App Flow
```
Login → See Assigned Pickups → Accept
→ Verify Code → Add Items → Submit for Approval
→ Status becomes Completed after customer approval
```

## 🔐 OTP and Code Logic

- OTP is hardcoded as **123456** for testing purposes  
- Pickup code is randomly generated by Partner App upon acceptance  
- Must match customer’s code to proceed to **"In-Process"**  

---

## 📦 Dependencies Used

- expo 
- `react-native`  
- `react-navigation`  
- `axios`  
- `json-server`  
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` (optional for persistence)

---

## ❗Important Notes

- 📶 Make sure your mobile device is on the same Wi-Fi network as your development machine when using `json-server`
- 🔁 Update all local URLs (`localhost`) to your IP address for real device/web compatibility
